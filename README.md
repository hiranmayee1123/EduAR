# EduAR

"EduAR" means Education with Augmented Reality
This website enables us to learn the concepts with 3D models, which makes our understanding easier. AR models of concepts make understanding faster with brief and accurate definitions.

This is the website where you can learn subjects using Augumented reality.
Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.
When u go to any sub-topic you will find "Experience the model using AR",if you go to that you will find a QR code. When you scan it,you can see the AR visual of the model
In our website you can learn by analysing the visualizations of Real-time models using AR.
